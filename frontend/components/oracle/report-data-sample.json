This provides a strategic advantage for planning a diverse dining itinerary.\n\n## Actionable Recommendations\n\n1. **Target Key Cities**: Focus your culinary exploration on Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. These cities are identified as having a high concentration of restaurants with diverse food offerings, ensuring a rich and varied dining experience.\n\n2. **Prioritize New York**: Given its high mean restaurant ID, prioritize New York for a broader range of culinary options.

The selection process is not restricted by any specific rating or city constraints, allowing for a broad exploration of culinary options. This optimization problem requires a strategic approach to ensure that the chosen restaurants collectively provide a variety of cuisines, enhancing the dining experience for an outing. The goal is to maximize the diversity of food types while meeting the minimum requirement of visiting five different establishments.\n\n## Context\n\nTo address this problem, we have access to a structured database that includes information about restaurants and their locations. The database schema consists of three tables: `geographic`, `location`, and `restaurant`. The `restaurant` table is particularly relevant as it contains details about each restaurant's ID, name, food type, city name, and rating. Although ratings and city names are available, they are not constraints in this selection process, allowing for a focus on food type diversity.\n\nThe `location` table provides the geographic coordinates of the restaurants, which could be useful for logistical planning of the outing. Although the `geographic` table offers broader regional data, it is less critical for this task since city constraints are not a factor.\n\nBy leveraging the available data, we can efficiently identify a set of restaurants that meet the criteria of diverse food offerings, ensuring a varied and enjoyable dining experience.\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n### \nIn this section, we will identify restaurant IDs along with their corresponding street names and house numbers for establishments that offer a diverse range of food types. This information is crucial to selecting restaurants that meet the criteria of providing variety without being limited by ratings or location, thereby supporting the broader objective of identifying diverse dining options.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT l.restaurant_id,\n       l.street_name,\n       l.house_number\nFROM LOCATION l\nJOIN restaurant r ON l.restaurant_id = r.id\nGROUP BY l.restaurant_id,\n         l.street_name,\n         l.house_number\nHAVING COUNT(DISTINCT r.food_type) > 1;\n```\n\nNo data fetched\n### \nIn this section, we will identify restaurant IDs along with their respective counties and regions for establishments that offer a diverse range of food types. This analysis is crucial to fulfilling the objective of selecting restaurants that provide varied culinary options, thereby enhancing the breadth of choices available without being limited by specific ratings or city locations.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT l.restaurant_id,\n                g.county,\n                g.region\nFROM LOCATION l\nJOIN geographic g ON l.city_name = g.city_name\nWHERE l.restaurant_id IN\n    (SELECT id\n     FROM restaurant\n     GROUP BY id\n     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT food_type) > 1);\n```\n\nNo data fetched\n### \nIn this section, we will identify restaurant IDs, names, and ratings for establishments that offer a diverse range of food types. This analysis is crucial for selecting restaurants that meet the criteria of variety in cuisine, thereby addressing the problem statement without imposing specific rating or city constraints.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT id,\n       name,\n       rating\nFROM restaurant\nWHERE food_type ILIKE '%variety%';\n```\n\nNo data fetched\n### Cities with Diverse Culinary Offerings and Their Restaurant ID Distribution\nIn this section, we explore the identification of restaurant IDs in cities renowned for their diverse culinary offerings, specifically focusing on Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. This analysis aims to support the broader objective of selecting restaurant IDs that provide a variety of food types, thereby highlighting the cities that contribute significantly to the diversity in culinary experiences.

Although there are no specific constraints regarding ratings or city locations, the available data allows for a comprehensive search across various regions, ensuring a diverse selection of dining options.\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n### Cities with Diverse Culinary Offerings and Their Restaurant ID Distribution\nIn this section, we explore the identification of cities that host restaurants offering a diverse range of food types, alongside the distribution of restaurant IDs within these locales. This analysis is crucial for understanding the geographical spread and concentration of culinary diversity, which can inform strategic decisions in the restaurant industry. By examining cities such as Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, we aim to highlight the potential hubs of gastronomic variety without delving into specific ratings or city constraints.\n<MultiTable><Table type={fetched_table_csv} csv={City Name,Restaurant ID\nLos Angeles,1\nLos Angeles,2\nLos Angeles,3\nNew York,4\nNew York,5\nNew York,6\nSan Francisco,7\nSan Francisco,8\nSan Francisco,9\n} /></MultiTable>\n\n<MultiTable><Table type={fetched_table_csv} csv={City Name,Restaurant ID\nLos Angeles,1\nLos Angeles,2\nLos Angeles,3\nNew York,4\nNew York,5\nNew York,6\nSan Francisco,7\nSan Francisco,8\nSan Francisco,9\n} /><Table type={table_csv} csv={City Name,Mean Restaurant ID,5th Percentile Restaurant ID,95th Percentile Restaurant ID\nLos Angeles,2.0,1.1,2.9\nNew York,5.0,4.1,5.9\nSan Francisco,8.0,7.1,8.9\n} /></MultiTable>\n\nThe table lists cities with restaurants offering a variety of food types, along with the mean, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of restaurant IDs in those cities.\n\n<Image src={q3.png} alt={A bar chart showing the relationship between city names and the mean restaurant IDs, indicating the variety of food types offered in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco.} />\n\n<MultiTable><Table type={fetched_table_csv} csv={City Name,Restaurant ID\nLos Angeles,1\nLos Angeles,2\nLos Angeles,3\nNew York,4\nNew York,5\nNew York,6\nSan Francisco,7\nSan Francisco,8\nSan Francisco,9\n} /><Table type={table_csv} csv={City Name,Mean Restaurant ID,5th Percentile Restaurant ID,95th Percentile Restaurant ID\nLos Angeles,2.0,1.1,2.9\nNew York,5.0,4.1,5.9\nSan Francisco,8.0,7.1,8.9\n} /></MultiTable>\n\nThe table lists cities with restaurants offering a variety of food types, along with the mean, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile of restaurant IDs in those cities.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT city_name,\n       id AS restaurant_id\nFROM restaurant\nWHERE city_name IN\n    (SELECT city_name\n     FROM restaurant\n     GROUP BY city_name\n     HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT food_type) > 1);\n```\n\nThe data indicates that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco have restaurants that offer a variety of food types, with New York having the highest mean restaurant ID and Los Angeles the lowest. This suggests that these cities have a diverse culinary scene. However, the data does not provide specific restaurant IDs, only statistical measures of their distribution.\n\n### Unanswered Questions\n\nThe unanswered questions suggest that there is a lack of data integration between restaurant details and their geographic or location information, as well as potential issues with the SQL queries' logic or data structure assumptions. In future efforts, it would be beneficial to ensure that the database schema supports these types of queries by verifying the relationships between tables and ensuring that the data is complete and accurately reflects the variety of food types offered by restaurants.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1.
