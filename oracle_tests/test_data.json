The selection must ensure that there are at least five different food types represented among the chosen restaurants. This optimization problem arises from the need to enhance the dining experience by offering a variety of culinary options, catering to different tastes and preferences. A well-curated selection of restaurants can significantly improve customer satisfaction and engagement during the outing.\n\n## Context\nTo address this problem, we have access to a database schema that includes three tables: `location`, `geographic`, and `restaurant`. The `restaurant` table is particularly relevant as it contains essential information such as the unique identifier for each restaurant, its rating, name, food type, and the city in which it is located. This data will be instrumental in identifying restaurants that meet the criteria of offering a variety of food types. The `location` table provides additional context regarding the physical addresses of the restaurants, which can be useful for logistical planning. However, there is no additional context provided regarding specific preferences or constraints beyond the requirement for variety. The available data will be leveraged to ensure a comprehensive selection process that meets the outlined criteria.\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n### \nIn this section, we will identify the restaurant_ids of establishments that not only provide a diverse selection of at least five different food types but also maintain the highest average ratings.
