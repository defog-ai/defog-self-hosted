The goal is to ensure that each selected restaurant provides a unique culinary experience by offering different food types. This selection process is crucial for individuals seeking a varied dining experience during an outing, thereby enhancing their culinary journey and satisfaction. The challenge lies in identifying and selecting restaurants that not only meet the criteria of diversity in food offerings but also maintain a standard of quality as indicated by their ratings.\n\n## Context\n\nTo address this problem, we have access to a comprehensive database schema that includes detailed information about restaurants, their locations, and the geographic regions they belong to. The `restaurant` table provides essential data such as the unique identifier for each restaurant, their ratings, names, and the type of food they serve. This information is pivotal in identifying restaurants that offer different food types. Additionally, the `location` table helps in pinpointing the exact location of each restaurant, which can be useful for logistical considerations. The `geographic` table offers insights into the broader regional context, which might be relevant for understanding cultural influences on the food types available. These data sources collectively enable a thorough analysis and informed decision-making process in selecting the optimal set of restaurants for a diverse culinary outing.\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n### Diversity of Food Types Offered by Restaurants\nIn this section, we will explore the various food types offered by restaurants within the dataset. Understanding the diversity of cuisines available is crucial for identifying restaurants that cater to a wide array of dietary preferences and cultural tastes, thereby enhancing our selection process for a varied dining experience. This analysis will inform our recommendations for restaurants that exemplify this culinary diversity.\n\n| Food Type   |\n|-------------|\n| Vegan       |\n| Seafood     |\n| American    |\n| Japanese    |\n| Mexican     |\n| Italian     |\n\nThe table lists the distinct food types offered by restaurants in the dataset, including Vegan, Seafood, American, Japanese, Mexican, and Italian.\n\n![A bar chart showing the relationship between different food types offered by restaurants, with each food type represented as a separate bar.](/backend/oracle/reports/test_restaurant/report_174/q0.png)\n\nFigure 1: A bar chart showing the relationship between different food types offered by restaurants, with each food type represented as a separate bar.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT r.food_type\nFROM restaurant AS r;\n```\n\nThe dataset reveals a diverse range of food types available at restaurants, highlighting a variety of cuisines such as Vegan, Seafood, American, Japanese, Mexican, and Italian. This variety suggests a broad culinary landscape, catering to different dietary preferences and cultural tastes.\n### Diversity of Food Types Offered by Restaurants in Major Cities\nIn this section, we will explore the distribution of various food types offered by restaurants across major cities. Understanding the number of restaurants that provide diverse culinary options is crucial for identifying urban areas with rich gastronomic landscapes, as well as those that may benefit from increased variety. This analysis highlights the disparities in food diversity, particularly between cities like Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco compared to Miami.\n\n| City Name     |   Food Types Count |\n|---------------|--------------------|\n| Los Angeles   |                  3 |\n| New York      |                  3 |\n| San Francisco |                  3 |\n| Miami         |                  1 |\n\nThe table displays the number of distinct food types offered by restaurants in various cities, with Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco each having 3 types, while Miami has 1 type.\n\n![A bar chart showing the relationship between city names and the count of distinct food types offered by restaurants, highlighting that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco have the highest variety with 3 food types each, while Miami has only 1.](/backend/oracle/reports/test_restaurant/report_174/q1.png)\n\nFigure 2: A bar chart showing the relationship between city names and the count of distinct food types offered by restaurants, highlighting that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco have the highest variety with 3 food types each, while Miami has only 1.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT r.city_name,\n       COUNT (DISTINCT r.food_type) AS food_types_count\nFROM restaurant AS r\nGROUP BY r.city_name\nORDER BY food_types_count DESC NULLS LAST;\n```\n\nThe analysis reveals that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco are the cities with the most diverse food offerings, each providing three distinct types of cuisine, while Miami has significantly less variety with only one type. This indicates a potential concentration of culinary diversity in certain urban areas compared to others.\n### Average Restaurant Ratings by Food Type\nIn this section, we will explore the average ratings of restaurants categorized by various food types. Understanding these ratings is crucial as they highlight customer satisfaction levels and reveal potential areas for improvement within specific cuisines, ultimately guiding strategic decisions for enhancing restaurant performance.\n\n| Food Type   |   Average Rating |\n|-------------|------------------|\n| Vegan       |            4.600 |\n| Italian     |            4.600 |\n| Seafood     |            4.500 |\n| Japanese    |            4.250 |\n| Mexican     |            4.100 |\n| American    |            3.800 |\n\nThe table presents the average ratings of restaurants categorized by different food types, with Italian cuisine having the highest average rating.\n\n![A bar chart showing the relationship between food types and their average restaurant ratings, with Italian cuisine leading in average rating.](/backend/oracle/reports/test_restaurant/report_174/q2.png)\n\nFigure 3: A bar chart showing the relationship between food types and their average restaurant ratings, with Italian cuisine leading in average rating.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT r.food_type,\n       AVG (r.rating) AS average_rating\nFROM restaurant AS r\nGROUP BY r.food_type\nORDER BY average_rating DESC NULLS LAST;\n```\n\nThe analysis reveals that Italian restaurants have the highest average rating among the food types listed, followed closely by Seafood and Japanese cuisines. American cuisine has the lowest average rating, indicating a potential area for improvement. The data does not show any missing values, but the variation in ratings suggests differing customer satisfaction across food types.\n### Counties with the Highest Variety of Food Types in Restaurants\nIn this section, we explore the counties that exhibit the highest diversity of food types within their restaurant offerings. Understanding the distribution of culinary variety is crucial for identifying regions that cater to a broad spectrum of consumer preferences and can influence strategic decisions for restaurant development and marketing. The analysis highlights key counties such as Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, which stand out for their extensive variety compared to others like Miami-Dade.\n\n| County        |   Food Type Count |\n|---------------|-------------------|\n| Los Angeles   |                 3 |\n| New York      |                 3 |\n| San Francisco |                 3 |\n| Miami-Dade    |                 1 |\n\nThe table lists the top counties along with the count of distinct food types available in their restaurants, showing that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco each have the highest variety with three food types, while Miami-Dade has one.\n\n![A bar chart showing the relationship between counties and the count of distinct food types in their restaurants, highlighting that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco have the highest counts of three food types each, while Miami-Dade has a lower count of one.](/backend/oracle/reports/test_restaurant/report_174/q3.png)\n\nFigure 4: A bar chart showing the relationship between counties and the count of distinct food types in their restaurants, highlighting that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco have the highest counts of three food types each, while Miami-Dade has a lower count of one.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nWITH restaurant_food_types AS\n  (SELECT g.county,\n          COUNT (DISTINCT r.food_type) AS food_type_count\n   FROM restaurant AS r\n   JOIN LOCATION AS l ON r.id = l.restaurant_id\n   JOIN geographic AS g ON l.city_name = g.city_name\n   GROUP BY g.county)\nSELECT county,\n       food_type_count\nFROM restaurant_food_types\nORDER BY food_type_count DESC NULLS LAST\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThe analysis reveals that Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco are tied for the highest variety of food types in their restaurants, each offering three distinct types, while Miami-Dade shows significantly less variety with only one type.
