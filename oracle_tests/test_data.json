This selection aims to provide a varied and enjoyable dining experience for an outing, catering to different culinary preferences and enhancing the overall satisfaction of the group.\n\n## Context\n\nTo address this optimization task, we have access to the restaurant database, which includes comprehensive information such as restaurant IDs, names, food types, city locations, and ratings. The relevant tables—`geographic`, `location`, and `restaurant`—provide necessary data points to identify restaurants that meet the criteria of variety and diversity in food offerings. Utilizing this data will allow us to effectively analyze and select the optimal set of restaurants that satisfy the requirement of having different food types for the outing.\n\n\n## Data Exploration\n### Diversity of Food Types and Customer Ratings in Selected Restaurants\nIn this section, we explore the range of food types provided by the selected restaurants, presenting each restaurant’s ID, food category, and customer ratings. This analysis is integral to identifying establishments that offer diverse culinary options while ensuring each restaurant specializes in a unique food type. Understanding these distinctions supports our objective of selecting restaurants that enhance our overall variety and meet quality standards.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT id,\n       food_type,\n       rating\nFROM restaurant;\n```\n\nAmerican cuisine is the most prevalent among the selected restaurants but tends to receive lower ratings compared to other food types such as Italian, Japanese, Vegan, and Seafood. Overall, most restaurants enjoy positive ratings, ranging from 3.70 to 4.70, indicating general customer satisfaction. There are no missing values or significant outliers in the dataset.\n### Comparative Analysis of Restaurant Ratings by City\nIn this section, we analyze the distribution of ratings for the selected restaurants across different cities. This evaluation is crucial to ensure that each restaurant not only offers a unique food type but also maintains high-quality standards within its respective urban market. By comparing city-specific performance, we can make informed decisions that align with our diversity and quality objectives.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT city_name,\n       id,\n       rating\nFROM restaurant;\n```\n\nRestaurant ratings are consistently high across cities, with Miami and New York exhibiting slightly higher average ratings compared to Los Angeles and San Francisco.

There are no significant outliers in the ratings data.\n### Consistently High Restaurant Ratings Across Counties with Miami-Dade and New York Leading\nIn this section, we examine how the ratings of selected restaurants differ across various counties by analyzing county name, restaurant ID, and rating. This evaluation highlights regional performance trends and identifies top-performing areas such as Miami-Dade and New York. Understanding these rating distributions is essential for selecting a diverse set of highly-rated restaurants that meet our criteria.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT geographic.county,\n       restaurant.id AS restaurant_id,\n       restaurant.rating\nFROM restaurant\nJOIN geographic ON restaurant.city_name = geographic.city_name;\n```\n\nRestaurant ratings are consistently high across all counties, with Miami-Dade and New York counties achieving the highest average ratings. Los Angeles and San Francisco also maintain strong ratings, though slightly lower than the top counties. There are no missing values or significant outliers in the dataset.\n### Regional Variations in Restaurant Ratings\nIn this section, we analyze the variation in restaurant ratings across different regions by examining the ratings of selected restaurants in each area. Our assessment reveals that New York achieves the highest average ratings, followed by Florida, while California, despite hosting the most restaurants, records a lower average rating. These findings underscore significant regional differences in customer satisfaction and overall restaurant quality.\n\n\nThis was generated with:\n```sql\nSELECT geographic.region,\n       restaurant.id,\n       restaurant.rating\nFROM restaurant\nJOIN geographic ON restaurant.city_name = geographic.city_name;\n```\n\nRestaurant ratings differ across regions, with New York leading with the highest average rating, followed by Florida, and California having the most restaurants but a lower average rating.
