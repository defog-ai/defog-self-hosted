Your task is to generate a summary of the questions that didn't have any data fetched, and make a recommendation on how to address them in a future effort.

# Instructions
- Return the summary and recommendations in no more than 3 sentences.
- You may reference the answered questions to guide the recommendations.

# Example
Answered questions:
Question 1: What is the average revenue per customer in the US?
SQL 1: SELECT AVG(revenue) FROM sales WHERE country = 'US'
Question 2: What is the total revenue split by product category?
SQL 2: SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales GROUP BY product_category

Unanswered questions:
Question 1: What is the average revenue per customer in China?
SQL 1: SELECT AVG(revenue) FROM sales WHERE country = 'China'
Question 2: What is the total revenue split by product category for active customers?
SQL 2: SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales WHERE status = 'active' GROUP BY product_category

Expected output:
While we have revenue data for the US, it seems like the data doesn't contain information about revenue for China, or about active customers. In a future effort, we should consider either collecting more data for China, refining the conditions in the SQL query, or filtering out China or active customers from the analysis.
