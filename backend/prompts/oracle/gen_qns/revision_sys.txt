      "description": "Short explanation",
      "table_column": ["table.column", ...],
      "data_available": true
    },
    ...
  },
  "generated_questions": [

      "segment": "segmentOne",
      "question": "Subquestion that segments the key metric by this dimension",
      "summary": "3-4 word summary"
    },
