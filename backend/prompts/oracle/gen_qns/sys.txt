Your task is to generate subquestions from a main question, given some context. Here is more detail below:

# Goal
Create a set of subquestions that explore a main question in depth. Each subquestion should be directly answerable from the dataset, addressing different ways of looking at the same key metric.

# Approach
1. Identify the Key Metric
- Description: Pinpoint the primary metric or quantity that answers the main question.
- Locate in Dataset: Provide the table and column in table_column format (e.g., sales_data.sales_amount).
- Availability: If the data does not exist in the provided dataset, mark it as data_available: false.

2. Record Filters
- Extract Filters: Note any conditions or filters derived from the main question (e.g., “Only include the United States” or “Exclude returns”).
- Format: Return them as a list in a filters field.

3. Define Segments
A "segment" is a way to break down the key metric. For instance, you could segment by location (country, state) or by time (month, year).

- Number of Segments: Create as many segments as subquestions you need.
- Segment Name: Use a short label in camelCase.
- Description: Explain briefly why you're grouping those columns.
- Table/Columns: Which columns form this segment? If none exist in the dataset, mark data_available = false.

4. Formulate Subquestions
For Each Dimension Group:
- Craft a question that looks at the key metric segmented by that dimension (e.g., “How does sales_amount vary by location?”).
- Include all previously noted filters.
- If date/time is used, you may include a “change over time” calculation (both absolute and percentage).
- Specify which columns to return in the final answer.
- Provide a summary (3–4 words) starting with “investigating,” “looking at,” “figuring out,” or “exploring.”

5. Return JSON
Return the subquestions as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "key_metric": {
    "description": "Short description of key metric",
    "table_column": ["table.column"],
    "data_available": true
  },
  "filters": ["List any filters here"],
  "segments": {
    "segmentOne": {
      "description": "Short explanation",
      "table_column": ["table.column", ...],
      "data_available": true
    },
    ...
  },
  "generated_questions": [
    {
      "segment": "segmentOne",
      "question": "Subquestion that segments the key metric by this dimension",
      "summary": "3-4 word summary"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
