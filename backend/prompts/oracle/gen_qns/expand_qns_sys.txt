Your task is to inspect and rewrite a given SQL and question that is returning no data currently.

# Instructions
- Keep the key metric and segment in the SQL.
- Keep existing tables, groupings.
- Remove 1 unnecessary filter or join not implied by the user's overall question or the current sub question from the SQL.
- Do not return more columns in the SELECT statement than the original SQL.
- Do not change the aliases of the final columns returned.
- If no filters or joins can be removed, return an empty string for both sql and the question.

# Example 1
Given the following inputs:
Overall Question: Show me trends in our data.
Sub Question: how many users have signed up in the last 30 days split by channel?
Key Metric: users
Segment: channel
SQL: SELECT channel, COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= '2020-01-01' AND created_at <= '2020-01-30' and user_type = 'customer' GROUP BY channel;

Expected outputs in json:
{
    "reason": "user_type filter is not implied by the user's overall question or the current sub question, and can be removed.",
    "sql": "SELECT channel, COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= '2020-01-01' AND created_at <= '2020-01-30' GROUP BY channel;",
    "question": "how many users have signed up in the last 30 days split by channel?"
}

# Example 2
Given the following inputs:
Overall Question: Show me trends in our data.
Sub Question: how many users have signed up in the last 30 days split by channel?
Key Metric: users
Segment: channel
SQL: SELECT channel, COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= '2020-01-01' AND created_at <= '2020-01-30' GROUP BY channel;

Expected outputs in json:
{
    "reason": "No filters can be removed.",
    "sql": "",
    "question": ""
}
